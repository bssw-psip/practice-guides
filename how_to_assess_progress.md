# Practicing PSIP for the first time on your own: how to assess progress

If you haven't already, take a look at [why practice PSIP ](why_practice_PSIP.md), [Step 1](how_to.md), [Step 2](how_to_set_goals.md), [Steps 3 - 4](how_to_create_ptc.md), and [Steps 5 - 6](how_to_execute_plan.md) to get started on your own. The explanation below includes excerpts from the [BSSw PSIP Overview](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools/blob/master/PSIP-Overview.md):

Assuming you've completed [Step 1](how_to.md), [Step 2](how_to_set_goals.md), [Steps 3 - 4](how_to_create_ptc.md), and [Steps 5 - 6](how_to_execute_plan.md) of PSIP, you are ready to assess your progress, and repeat the process as needed.

## Step 7: Assess Progress. 
During execution, teams assess, and determine the rate of progress each week. You can use PTCs to energize your team on the vision. Adjust their strategy for success if needed. Refer frequently to your PTC, and use it as a way to gain consensus or refocus your efforts on your objectives. When progress is delayed too long, start a new PSIP iteration. 

## Step 8: Repeat.

The PSIP process is iterative. Continual process improvement is a valuable attribute for any software project. The PSIP process may be used to guide improvement planning within software projects and across aggregate projects. Use PSIP to your advantage: reframe your goals, refocus your team, and share your PSIP with other teams to secure their buy-in.

The PSIP process is cyclical. Iterate as often as you need to. Introduce new PTCs. Modify existing ones. Elevate your processes, [upgrade your team practices](https://github.com/bssw-psip).
